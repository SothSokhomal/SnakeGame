# SnakeGame
This is a classic Snake game built using Python and the Pygame library. In this game, the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, trying to eat food while avoiding collisions with walls or itself. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, increasing the challenge.

# Features

- Smooth Controls: Arrow keys to move the snake in all four directions.
- Growing Snake: The snake grows longer with each food item eaten.
- Score Tracking: Keeps track of the player’s score and displays it on the screen.
- Game Over Conditions: Ends when the snake hits the wall or itself.
- Customizable Grid: Easy to adjust game speed, screen size, and snake/food appearance.
